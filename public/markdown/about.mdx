## TL;DR
I work on computer graphics using Vulkan and C++. I am building my own engine and document graphics/systems programming
experiments here and on my YouTube channel. I have a history building web and mobile applications.

### Focus
I love working on low-level graphics and systems programming. Currently, I'm a senior at the Georgia Institute of Technology, but I'm developing my own engine
after hours. I run a YouTube channel and this blog to teach others about what I've learned through my journey as well as experimenting with interesting implementation strategies.

### Tools
##### Main
- **C/C++** - Languages I use to write graphics and systems applications
- **Vulkan** - API I use to communicate with GPU's
- **React/TypeScript** - How I made this website and others
##### Auxiliary
- **x64 ASM** - Used for measuring low-level performance
- **Zig, Golang, Java, Swift** - Languages I've used heavily in the past

### History
For years, I focused on creating engaging and accessible websites and mobile Apps. I've worked on tools for musicians to host live events,
a conversational English learning app, a comfort tracker app to assist outdoor workers during hotter months and more, and a mental health tracker which
launched on iOS app store. These and other examples of my work can be found on my LinkedIn and GitHub.

While I loved building interactive experiences through the medium of the web and mobile, I discovered a greater love for graphics and low-level programming later on.

### Hobbies
I love to rock climb, go hiking, and play guitar. Also, nothing beats just spending quality time with the people I love &lt;3
